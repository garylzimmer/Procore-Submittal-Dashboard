# Procore Submittal Dashboard

Original purpose was that my boss just wanted me to take the table as procore exports it and add contact details for the submitters. This was easy thanks to Procore's Directory feature, but considering the constantly changing data, I thought a more autonomous solution would be useful and a good learning opportunity. Now that this data is being constantly updated within an excel sheet, all kinds of manipulations are possible.

Currently implemented features in my DASHBOARD sheet are:

	 -Submitter's phone #s and email at a glance
 	
	 -Clickable email addresses that open Outlook
 
 	 -User-defined comments per submittal row
 
	 -User-friendly login form
 
 	 -Saving login details



Planned features are:

	 -Alternating row colors (for readability)
 
	 -Conditional formatting based on submittal status
 
 	 -Automated downloading of all submittal attachments into seperated folders
	 
	 -Increasing security (probably not the best to have user/password in plaintext in both a hidden sheet and as strings in the master module
